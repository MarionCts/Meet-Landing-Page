## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a meet landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Solution retrospective

In this solution, I used Sass for the first time to work with a CSS preprocessor. I initially struggled to write SCSS code due to my long-established habits with pure CSS. However, I quickly discovered that being able to define multiple variables was a game-changer, and I really enjoyed coding this way. I also practiced writing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code and naming elements according to the BEM methodology (blocks, elements, modifiers).


Including the time I spent learning Sass, it took me two days to complete this solution. I wanted to further experiment with the clamp property to keep the page responsive, although I sometimes found it unnecessarily complicated. Could someone offer advice on how to maintain code that is both responsive and simple?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
